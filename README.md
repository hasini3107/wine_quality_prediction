# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

A Machine Learning project that predicts the **quality of red wine** based on its physicochemical properties using a trained **Random Forest model** and an interactive **Streamlit web application**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Wine quality depends on several chemical factors such as acidity, alcohol content, sulphates, and pH.  
This project applies **machine learning techniques** to analyze these features and predict wine quality accurately.

The application allows users to input wine parameters and instantly receive a **quality prediction**.
